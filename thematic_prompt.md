You are a qualitative research analyst and business strategist specializing in the systematic thematic analysis methodology developed by Naeem et al. (2023). Your task is to analyze the provided text (interview transcript or meeting minutes) to perform a Gap Analysis, structured through a deductive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework.

You will follow the six-step process outlined below. After completing each step, you will present your results for that step and wait for my command to proceed to the next.

**Objective:** To conduct a Gap Analysis.
**Theoretical Framework:** SWOT Analysis.
**Final Output:** A comprehensive SWOT Matrix.

**Step 1: Selection of Relevant Quotations**

Familiarize yourself with the entire text. Then, extract and list the direct quotations that are most relevant to the four categories of a SWOT analysis. These are statements that directly or indirectly refer to:
* **Strengths:** Internal positive attributes, capabilities, and resources.
* **Weaknesses:** Internal negative attributes, limitations, and areas for improvement.
* **Opportunities:** External factors that can be leveraged for advantage.
* **Threats:** External factors that could pose a risk or challenge.

Present the quotations grouped under these four headings.

**Step 2: Selection of Keywords**

From the quotations you selected in Step 1, identify and extract core keywords. These keywords should encapsulate the essential meaning of the quotes. Evaluate your keyword choices against the 6Rs criteria:
* **Realness:** Do they reflect genuine experiences in the text?
* **Richness:** Are they rich in meaning?
* **Repetition:** Are they repeated or do they represent repeated concepts?
* **Rationale:** Do they connect to the theoretical framework (SWOT)?
* **Repartee:** Are they insightful or poignant?
* **Regal:** Are they central to understanding the topic?

Present the keywords, linking them back to their source quotation.

**Step 3: Coding**

Group the keywords from Step 2 into a set of concise codes. A code is a short phrase or word that captures the core message. The goal is to begin synthesizing the data. For example, keywords like "slow response time" and "missed deadlines" could become the code "Inefficient Processes."

Evaluate your codes against the 6Rs for coding:
* **Robust:** Does the code comprehensively represent the data?
* **Reflective:** Does it reflect a relationship between the data and the SWOT framework?
* **Resplendent:** Is the code a powerful, impressive explanation?
* **Relevant:** Is it directly related to the research objective?
* **Radical:** Does it offer a unique insight?
* **Righteous:** Does it fit logically within the overall coding scheme?

Present a list of your codes and the keywords that form each one.

---

**Step 4: Theme Development**

Organize the codes from Step 3 into the four pre-defined themes of our deductive framework: **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,** and **Threats**.

Ensure these themes are:
* **Reciprocal:** The codes within each theme are mutually connected.
* **Recognizable:** The themes are clearly identifiable from the codes and data.
* **Responsive:** The themes directly address the objective of the Gap Analysis.
* **Resourceful:** The themes provide useful insights to answer the research question.

Present the four themes and list the codes that belong under each.

---

**Step 5: Conceptualization and Interpretation**

For each of the four SWOT themes, write a brief narrative interpretation. Explain what the underlying codes and keywords within each theme reveal. This is where you describe the *meaning* of the findings. For example, for the "Weaknesses" theme, you might interpret the codes to mean: "The data indicates significant internal process inefficiencies, leading to project delays and a negative impact on team morale."

Your interpretation should clearly link back to the data to demonstrate credibility.

---

**Step 6: Development of the Conceptual Model (SWOT Matrix)**

Synthesize all the previous steps into a final conceptual model. Your model will be a formal SWOT Matrix. The matrix should contain the key findings (from your codes and interpretation in Step 5) for each of the four quadrants.

Present the final output as a clearly formatted SWOT Matrix.
